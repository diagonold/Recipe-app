VERY IMPORTANT TO THINK OF ARCHITECTURE
    WE ARE USING MVC MODEL
    MODEL CONTROLLER VIEW

in the context of our actual app
    1. CONTROLLER
        it is our choice to make 1 global controller
        script - index.js

    2. MODEL
        script - search.js

    3. VIEW
        script- seachView.js

How ES6 modules work?
    default


    // import string from './models/Search';
    // // import multiple things from a module use { their exact names }
    // // import { multiply, add } from './views/searchView';
    // import * as searchView from './views/searchView';


// console.log(`add ${searchView.add(2,3)}`);
// console.log(`multiply ${searchView.multiply(2,4)}`);
// console.log(`string ${string}`);





// axios library
// popular http request
// this works on all browsers
// why is axios better?
//   work the same way as fetch, automatically converts to json
// it is much better to use axios to make http calls



Building the search controller  
    learning the concept of application state
    learn a simple way of implementing state

    what is a state?
        the number of likes, the search being reutrned, who is logged in, number of people on the site
        etc etc

    we can use an object to keep track of the state of our app. 
    This is a simple way of keeping track of all the states of our app.

    in React, we keep track of states using redux
